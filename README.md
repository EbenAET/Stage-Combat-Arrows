# Stage-Combat-Arrows
## A teaching tool for stage combat. These 3d printed arrows are large and easy to see. They point in the direction of the blade edge to help those training in stage combat to get used to blade orientation.

### Background: 
Professor Zev Steinrock at UIUC came to me requesting a simple solution to a visual tool he's incorporated when teaching his students the basics of stage combat with blades. Prof. Steinrock used hand cut cardboard arrows that would be skewered on the blades so the arrows would point towards the blade edge. Because of the time and material waste inherent in the creation of the cardboard arrows, he asked if I could come up with a simpler solution. Through basic iteration, I modeled a 3d printed arrow that contains a small rectangular window in the center and a screwdown clamp to keep a gripping medium in place. For the gripping medium, I've been using small rectangular cuts of neoprene yoga mats, though I am also trying out high friction rubber, and of course regular cardboard could be used as well. When the gripping medium wears out, it is easy to replace with another small rectangular piece. When using the neoprene and rubber, I recommend pre-punching screw holes to keep the material from jamming in the threads of the nuts.

### Materials needed (per unit made):
- 3x 6-32 Hex Nuts | [McMaster Carr Item 90480A007](https://www.mcmaster.com/90480A007/)
- 3x 6-32x1/4 Low Head SOC Cap Machine Screws | [McMaster Carr Item 93615A210](https://www.mcmaster.com/93615A210/)
- Super Glue
- Printer filament (I used PLA-CR)
- Finishing enamel (I used clear nail polish)
- Spray paint (if desired)
- Clear polycrylic (if paint is used)
- Gripping medium (I used neoprene rubber)

### 3d Printing Settings
- Layer height - 0.08
- Ironing - All top surfaces
- Support - on (to help support hex sockets)

### Assembly
1. Print out *both .svgs*
2. Glue 6-32 nuts into hex sockets - **be sure not to get glue in threads**
3. When glue is cured, apply enamel coat to 3d printed pieces
4. When enamel is cured, spray paint two even layers on all visable faces (if desired) | **I recommend setting screws into nuts for painting to keep paint from getting in the threads**
5. When paint is cured, lightly brush on one coat of clear polycrylic (if painted)
6. Cut a small rectangle of your gripping medium sized to fit in the arrow window frame
7. (Optional) pre-punch holes to make it easier to screw in machine screws
8. Compress gripping medium between arrow and clamp, install the 3 machine screws
9. Cut a small vertical slice in the center of the medium, smaller than the blade it will be used on
10. Skewer arrow on blade, pointing towards edge
